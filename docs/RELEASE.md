# Release process

This project should release small, useful versions instead of batching unrelated work. A release is appropriate when the project gains a user-visible fix, scanner improvement, docs improvement, or GitHub Action behavior change.

## Cadence

When the project is active, aim for a release at least monthly. Release sooner for fixes that unblock CI usage or correct bad coverage results.

## Preflight

Before cutting a release:

```bash
git status --short
npm ci
npm run check
npm run build
```

Then dogfood the CLI against at least one real project or fixture:

```bash
npx msw-inspector --report-file msw-inspector.json --format json
```

Review the report for obvious false positives, false negatives, or unsupported patterns that should be documented.

## Versioning

Use semver:

- Patch: bug fixes, docs, small output improvements.
- Minor: new supported static patterns, new CLI options, GitHub Action additions.
- Major: breaking CLI, JSON schema, or package behavior changes.

Update `CHANGELOG.md` before publishing.

## Publish checklist

1. Confirm `npm run check` and `npm run build` pass.
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. On a release branch, run `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version` (or the appropriate minor/major bump), then open and merge the release PR.
4. Create and push an annotated tag for the exact merged `main` commit.
5. Create and publish a GitHub release from that tag with the changelog notes. The release-triggered publish workflow runs the checks, builds the package, and publishes to npm.
6. Verify the published npm version and `latest` dist-tag. Do not run `npm publish` locally as part of this workflow.
7. If `src/github-action/` changed, refresh the action repository: run `npm run build:action`, copy `dist/action/index.js` to `dist/index.js` in `felmonon/msw-inspector-action` (the self-contained bundle `action.yml` points at), commit there, and move the `v1` tag to the new release.
8. Open or update a follow-up roadmap issue for the next release.

Do not publish from a dirty worktree unless the only changes are intentional release files.
