# Changelog

All notable changes to this project should be documented here.

## Unreleased

- Fixed stale-handler false positives: every handler matching a call is now marked used, not just the first.
- Text output now lists unmocked API calls and stale handlers with file and line; `--limit` controls how many.
- The CLI validates `--format`, `--min-coverage`, and `--limit` (usage errors exit 2), warns on empty scans, and supports `--fail-on-empty`. Exit codes are documented in the README.
- Report file paths are now relative to `--cwd` with forward slashes on every platform, making reports portable across machines.
- Calls with statically unresolvable HTTP methods that path-match a handler are reported as `ambiguousCalls`/`ambiguousCallIds` instead of unmocked; their handlers are not flagged stale.
- Added support for `fetch(new Request(url, init))` with static arguments.
- The JSON report contract is documented in `docs/report-schema.md` and defined in `schema/coverage-report.v1.json`, which ships with the npm package and is validated in tests.
- `felmonon/msw-inspector-action` is now the canonical GitHub Action; this repository no longer ships `action.yml` or committed `dist/` output.
- CI now tests Node 18/20/22 on Ubuntu and Windows.
- Added end-to-end CLI tests covering output formats, `--report-file`, and all exit codes.
- Added contributor documentation, issue templates, a pull request template, roadmap, and release process notes.
