Find gaps in your API mock coverage before they reach CI.

`msw-inspector` scans your MSW handlers and your application API calls, compares both sides, and reports what is covered, what is unmocked, and which mocks look stale.

## Why this exists

Mock coverage usually decays quietly:

- a feature adds `fetch('/billing')` but no matching MSW handler
- an old handler survives after the app stops calling that endpoint
- relative URLs and origin-specific URLs drift apart
- CI can tell you tests passed, but not whether the API surface is still mocked

`msw-inspector` makes that drift visible. It is intentionally static and conservative: when it cannot understand a dynamic pattern, it reports the pattern as unsupported instead of guessing.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D msw-inspector-cli
```

The npm package is published as `msw-inspector-cli` because `msw-inspector` is already an active npm package in the MSW ecosystem for runtime request inspection. This project is a static coverage analyzer, and the installed binary remains `msw-inspector`.

## Quick start

Run it from the project root:

```bash
npx msw-inspector
```

Or run it without installing first:

```bash
npx msw-inspector-cli
```

For CI, write the full report and fail on the rules that matter to your project:

```bash
npx msw-inspector \
  --report-file msw-inspector.json \
  --format json \
  --min-coverage 80 \
  --fail-on-unmocked
```

## Terminal demo

Screenshot-friendly text output:

```text
$ npx msw-inspector --base-url https://api.example.com --min-coverage 80
✓ 4 handlers found
✓ 6 API calls found
✗ 2 unmocked endpoints
✓ 0 stale mocks

Coverage: 66.7% (4/6)

Unmocked API calls:
  POST /api/chat  src/chat.ts:12
  GET /api/profile  src/profile.ts:33
◌ 1 unsupported patterns skipped

✗ 66.7% mock coverage — 2 unmocked calls
```

Text output lists up to 10 unmocked calls and stale handlers with their source locations. Use `--limit <count>` to show more or fewer.

Use `--format json` when you want the full report for CI, dashboards, or the companion GitHub Action.

## Matching example

Given these handlers:

```ts
import { http } from 'msw'

export const handlers = [
  http.get('/users/:id', () => null),
  http.post('/checkout', () => null),
]
```

And these API calls:

```ts
import axios from 'axios'

await fetch('https://api.example.com/users/123?include=profile')
await axios.post('/checkout')
await fetch('/billing')
```

`msw-inspector` reports two covered calls and one unmocked call. Route parameters and query strings are normalized, so `/users/:id` matches `/users/123?include=profile`.

If your app uses relative URLs but you want origin-aware matching, set `--base-url`:

```bash
npx msw-inspector --base-url https://api.example.com
```

That resolves relative handlers and API calls against one canonical origin, which is useful when the same pathname exists on multiple backends.

## Useful flags

```bash
npx msw-inspector \
  --handlers "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mts,mjs,cjs}" \
  --sources "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mts,mjs,cjs}" \
  --exclude "**/dist/**" "**/*.d.ts" \
  --base-url "https://api.example.com" \
  --report-file msw-inspector.json \
  --format text
```

For copy-paste setups, see [`docs/examples/vite-vitest.md`](docs/examples/vite-vitest.md)
for Vite + Vitest and [`docs/examples/nextjs.md`](docs/examples/nextjs.md) for
Next.js.

Common CI gates:

```bash
npx msw-inspector --min-coverage 90
npx msw-inspector --fail-on-unmocked
npx msw-inspector --fail-on-stale
npx msw-inspector --fail-on-empty
```

`--fail-on-empty` fails when the scan finds no handlers and no API calls, which usually means misconfigured globs or `--cwd`; an empty scan always prints a warning to stderr.

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | Analysis ran; no enabled gate failed. |
| 1 | A gate failed (`--min-coverage`, `--fail-on-unmocked`, `--fail-on-stale`, `--fail-on-empty`) or the analysis errored. |
| 2 | Usage error: unknown flag or invalid value for `--format`, `--min-coverage`, or `--limit`. |


## JSON report

The JSON report written by `--report-file` includes a stable schema version and a summary:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "summary": {
    "mockedCalls": 23,
    "totalCalls": 31,
    "usedHandlers": 20,
    "totalHandlers": 23,
    "staleHandlers": 3,
    "unmockedCalls": 8,
    "ambiguousCalls": 0,
    "percentage": 74.2
  }
}
```

## Dogfooding

Here is a real run against `typejung.com`:

![Real dogfood run against typejung.com](./assets/typejung-dogfood.svg)

Dogfood summary:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "mockedCalls": 0,
    "totalCalls": 24,
    "usedHandlers": 0,
    "totalHandlers": 0,
    "staleHandlers": 0,
    "unmockedCalls": 24,
    "percentage": 0
  },
  "unsupported": 7,
  "sampleUnmocked": [
    "POST https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "GET https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo",
    "POST /api/chat",
    "POST /api/create-checkout-session"
  ]
}
```

That run surfaced a complete mock gap across auth, billing, and AI endpoints instead of a single missing handler.

All file locations in the report are relative to the scanned directory (`--cwd`), using forward slashes on every platform, so reports are stable across machines and safe to store as CI baselines.

The full report format is documented in [docs/report-schema.md](./docs/report-schema.md) and defined machine-readably in [schema/coverage-report.v1.json](./schema/coverage-report.v1.json), which ships with the npm package.

## Supported patterns

The first release is intentionally narrow:

- `msw` `http.*` handlers
- legacy `msw` `rest.*` handlers
- handler matchers from string literals, static template literals, static `const`s, `new URL(...).href`, `new URL(...).toString()`, and `String(new URL(...))`
- `fetch(...)`, `window.fetch(...)`, `globalThis.fetch(...)`, and `fetch(new Request(...))` with static arguments
- common `axios` call shapes, including `axios.get(...)`, `axios.request(...)`, `axios(...)`, and same-file `axios.create(...)` instances

Unsupported dynamic or ambiguous patterns are included in the report so you can decide whether to simplify the code, add explicit handlers, or ignore the pattern.

## GitHub Action

The canonical GitHub Action is [`felmonon/msw-inspector-action`](https://github.com/felmonon/msw-inspector-action). It reads the JSON report that the CLI already produced, writes a job summary, and can optionally upsert one sticky PR comment.

The action's source lives in this repository under `src/github-action/`; its built bundle is vendored into the action repository at release time. This repository intentionally does not ship its own `action.yml` — always use `felmonon/msw-inspector-action` in workflows.

Marketplace listing: [`MSW Inspector`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/msw-inspector)

```yaml

          cache: npm

        with:
          summary-file: msw-inspector.json
          comment: true
```

The action does not compute a baseline delta yet. It publishes the current report cleanly and predictably.

## Node API

```ts
import { analyzeProject, formatCoverageReport } from 'msw-inspector-cli'

const report = await analyzeProject({
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
})

console.log(formatCoverageReport(report))
```

## Limitations

- It does not try to infer custom wrapper helpers.
- It does not resolve cross-file constants or imported axios instances.
- It does not analyze GraphQL, WebSocket, or SSE handlers.
- It reports dynamic or ambiguous patterns as unsupported instead of guessing.
- Calls whose HTTP method cannot be resolved statically are reported as `ambiguousCalls` when their path matches a handler; they never count as mocked or unmocked, and `--fail-on-unmocked` ignores them.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

If you are changing the scanning logic, keep the test fixtures small and explicit. The tool is more useful when it stays opinionated.

## Contributing

`msw-inspector` is open to focused contributions that improve real MSW coverage workflows. The strongest issues include a small handler/API-call example, the command that was run, and the expected coverage result.

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md). Good first contributions include framework examples, focused scanner fixtures, clearer unsupported-pattern messages, and docs that help teams add the CLI to CI.

Current open-source focus:

- Make adoption simple for Vite, Next.js, Vitest, Playwright, and GitHub Actions users.
- Improve static scanner precision without guessing dynamic runtime behavior.
- Keep the JSON report and GitHub Action output stable enough for CI.
